# datagene

DATAGENE is a Tabular Generation library that also trains the appropriate model on generated data. Utilies like [CTGAN UTILITY](https://sdv.dev/CTGAN/api/ctgan.synthesizer.html) and [Auto ML Framework](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/save-and-load-model.html) have helped to build this algorithm.

## Main Features
 - [x] Works any dataset
 - [x] Selective of features/columns in Dataset depending upon their Datatype
 - [x] Generates data for those columns/features that are required
 - [x] Displays a Fit Curve Graph that helps to compare how much is area overlap between predicted and actual value
